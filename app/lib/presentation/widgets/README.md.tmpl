# Organization of files in the 'widgets' folder

This folder is designed to organize the widgets of your application in an orderly and structured manner. 
Here you can separate your widgets into subfolders according to their type or functionality, which will facilitate their maintenance and reuse in different parts of your project.

## Folder Structure

The suggested folder structure for the widgets folder is as follows:

widgets/
├── inputs/
├── layouts/
├── *
├── *
├── *


This structure helps us maintain organized and scalable code as we add more models or functionalities to the project.
