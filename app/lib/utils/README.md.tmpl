# Organization of files in the 'utils' folder

Folder where reusable generic functionalities are stored throughout the project, agnostic to its context.

Here is a recommended way to organize this folder:

## Folder structure

The 'utils' folder can be organized into subfolders according to the functionality or type of utility they contain.
Below are some suggestions on how to structure these subfolders:

├── utils/
  ├── date_helpers/
  ├── int_helpers/
  ├── string_helpers/
  ├── json_helpers/
  ├── *
  ├── *
  ├── *
  ├── *

This structure helps us maintain organized and scalable code as we add more functionalities to the project.
