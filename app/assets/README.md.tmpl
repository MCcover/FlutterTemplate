### Organizing Files in the Assets Folder

Organizing files within the `assets` folder in a structured manner enhances code readability and maintenance. 
The following structure is suggested:

- **images/**: For images, with subfolders for icons, backgrounds, avatars, etc.
- **fonts/**: For custom text fonts.
- **audio/**: For sound files.
- **videos/**: For video files.
- **data/**: For data files such as JSON, CSV, etc.
- **others/**: For other types of files.

#### Example:
assets/
├── images/
├── fonts/
├── audio/
├── videos/
└── data/

Adjust this structure according to the specific requirements of your project.
